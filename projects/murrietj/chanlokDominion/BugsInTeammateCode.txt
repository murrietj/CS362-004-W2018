Description: 
	After playing the Smithy card, the player ends up with 1 less card than 
    expected in his hand and one more than expected in his deck. It seems that 
    2 cards are being drawn instead of 3.
How to reproduce:
	Initialize a game with Smithy as a playable card and at least 2 players. On 
    any of the player’s turn, make sure they have a Smithy in their hand, possibly 
    by explicitly placing it in their hand. Then simply playing the card. The bug 
    seems to be persistent regardless of any other input (e.g. deck size, hand size, 
    discard pile, number of players, etc.).
